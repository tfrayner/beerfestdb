   Some pseudocode which hopefully explains how one might handle each

   if ( measurement ) {
       if ( measurement <= old_value ) {
           accept;
       }
       if ( measurement > old_value ) {
           flag as exception;
           error = "blah blah";
       }
   else {     # no measurement
       if ( old_value > 0 ) {
           accept;
       }
       if ( old_value <= 0 ) {
          flag as exception any attempt to enter new measurement in future;
       }
   }
