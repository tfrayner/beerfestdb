=head1 NAME

BeerFestDB::DipMunger - Utility functions for CaskMeasurements.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a Role class providing utility functions for dealing with
CaskMeasurement data in sparse database format.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 munge_dips

Given a BeerFestDB::ORM::Cask row this method simply returns a list of
dip measurements up to and including the latest dip for which any
figures are available within a Festival. This method is used to fill
in gaps in the record caused by sparse recording of dip figures (e.g.,
we don't dip when either full or empty).
