BeerfestDB
==========

Create a MySQL database, and set up the database by loading in
db/create_tables.sql and db/initialise_vocabs.sql, in that order.

Make a copy of beerfestdb_web.yml-example as beerfestdb_web.yml and
edit it to add the database connection details.

Run script/beerfestdb_web_server.pl to test the application.
